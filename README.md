# autoencoder-image-compression
This project implements an autoencoder for image compression using the MNIST dataset. The model utilizes convolutional layers to encode images into a lower-dimensional representation and reconstruct them, demonstrating the effectiveness of autoencoders in unsupervised learning tasks. Explore the code for training and visualization.
